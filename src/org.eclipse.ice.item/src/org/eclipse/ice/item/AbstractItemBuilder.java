/**
 * This is a conceptually abstract (but concretely implemented) realization of
 * the ItemBuiler interface that is designed to simply cut down on the amount of
 * code and knowledge needed to implement that interface. Implementations of
 * that interface are 90% redundant, so they are a good candidate for base
 * classes.
 * 
 * This class also provides built-in registration hooks for common services,
 * such as the IActionFactory, so that subclasses only have to point the OSGi to
 * their subclass. Registration of the services with the Item are handled
 * automatically in the build() operation.
 * 
 * Subclasses should override getInstance() and provide a new instance of their
 * Item. Subclasses that require new services should override setServices() and
 * call super.setServices() after they register their own services so that the
 * base class can perform its registrations.
