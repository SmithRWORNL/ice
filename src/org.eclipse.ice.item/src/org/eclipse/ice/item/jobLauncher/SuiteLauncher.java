/**
 * The SuiteLauncher is capable of launching suites of codes where a suite is
 * defined as a code base with multiple executables, each for solving a
 * different problem. This includes codes like SHARP, MOOSE and Nek5000.
 * 
 * The SuiteLauncher relies on several very simple overrides of operations on
 * the JobLauncher base class and provides very little new capability. It
 * provides all of the normal capabilities of a JobLauncher.
 * 
 * Like JobLauncher, the setupForm operation has to be called early by
 * SuiteLauncher subclasses. It should be called after the list of executables
 * is provided with addExecutables() and it will add an additional component
 * from which the executable can be selected. The additional component has an id
 * equal to JobLauncherForm.parallelId + 2.
 * 
 * The setExecutable operation is overridden to only set the executable and not
 * the Form details like in the JobLauncher.
 * 
 * The reviewEntries operation is overridden to reset the executable when the
 * Form is submitted.
 * 
 * The only thing that can be tested with this class is the public
 * setExecutables operation because it relies on JobLauncher to do all of the
 * heavy lifting.
 * 
 * The updateExecutablePath operation should be overridden by subclasses that
 * serve codes with a hierarchical layout. The SuiteLauncher assumes that the
 * directory structure is flat by default such that all executables can be found
 * with ${installDir}/${executable} is always true. Overriding
 * updateExecutablePath allows subclasses to have unique layouts like
 * ${installDir}/${executable}-specialFolder/${executable}.
